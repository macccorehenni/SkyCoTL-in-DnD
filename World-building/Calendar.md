# Skyrealm calendar

The calendar is divided into eleven months (with a special week every three years). Every week is 7 days, execpt every three years excepting every 60 unless that year is evenly divided by forty.

That made no sense?

Well, letâ€™s break it down by month.

## Year-break
Being the first month of the year, Year-break is naturally one of the longest.
